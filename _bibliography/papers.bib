abstract = {Discovering evolutionary traits that are heritable across species on the tree of life (also referred to as a phylogenetic tree) is of great interest to biologists to understand how organisms diversify and evolve. However, the measurement of traits is often a subjective and labor-intensive process, making trait discovery a highly label-scarce problem. We present a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -or codes- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing biologically meaningful results in a number of downstream tasks including species image generation and species-to-species image translation, using fish species as a target example},

abstract = {Understanding species evolution across the tree of life, commonly known as a phylogenetic tree is a significant area of interest for biologists. The measurement of species traits often relies on subjective assessments and is labor-intensive, leading to a notable shortage of labeled data essential for identifying traits. In this work, we explore integrating biological knowledge with generative models specifically Latent Diffusion Models. We evaluate four different conditioning techniques: Class Conditional, Scientific Name Encoding, Tree-to-Text (T2T) Encoding, and Hierarchical Level Encoding to integrate the phylogenetic information. We validate the methods with their proficiency in generating biologically meaningful images and the ability to capture phenotypical information, aiding in the discovery of novel biological traits.},
