Hi :wave: Welcome to my personal space!

A little about me: I am a Computer Engineering Master’s student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) and I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Science-guided Machine Learning Lab under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/). Previously, I had completed my Bachelor’s from Delhi Technological University, India in Electrical Engineering and later worked as a Software Engineer at Fractal Analytics and a Quantitative Trading startup (Theremi.ai) before finally joining VT.

My primary research interests since undergrad have been in the Machine Learning domain. While I explored multiple diverse areas in ML during my undergrad, at the Vision and AI Lab (VAL) at IISc Bangalore, my primary area of research is Computer Vision. My current research interests include Science-guided Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and multi-modal learning problems. Moreover, I am also interested in ML research in Biology. I'm also a part of the [Imageomics Institue](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) funded by NSF.
