Hi :wave: Welcome to my personal space !

A little about me. I am a Computer Engineering Master’s student at Virginia Tech and I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Knowledge-guided Machine Learning Lab under the guidance of my advisor Prof. Anuj Karpatne. Previously, I had completed by Bachelor’s from Delhi Technological University, India in Electrical Engineering and later worked as a Software Engineering at Fractal Analytics and a Quantitative Trading startup (Theremi.ai) before finally joining VT.

My primary research interests since undergrad have been in the Machine Learning domain. While I explored multiple diverse areas in ML during my undergrad, at Video and AI Lab at IISc Bangalore, my primary area of work was Computer Vision. Presently, my research interests include Science-guided Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and multi-modal learning problems. Moreover, I am also interested in ML research in Biology.
