A little about me: I am a Computer Engineering Master’s student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu) and I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Science-guided Machine Learning Lab under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/). 
Previously, I had completed my Bachelor’s from Delhi Technological University, India in Electrical Engineering and later worked as a Software Engineer at Fractal Analytics and a Quantitative Trading startup (Theremi.ai) before finally joining VT.

My research interest since undergrad has been in Machine Learning. While I explored multiple diverse areas in ML during my undergrad, at the Vision and AI Lab (VAL) at IISc Bangalore, I focused on Computer Vision. My current research interests include Multi-modal learning, using text, graphs, or science with Computer Vision models. Moreover, I am also interested in AI for Science. 

I'm a part of the [Imageomics Institue](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) funded by NSF and the [Sanghani Center for AI & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/person/mridul-khurana/) at Virginia Tech

Apart from academia, I love playing Basketball and going for hikes. I also love playing drums, always open for a jam session!
