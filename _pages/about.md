Hi, I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu), currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [KGML Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/) under the guidance of [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).
Before that, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical Engineering at  Delhi Technological University, India, and later worked as a Software Engineer at Fractal Analytics and a Quantitative Trading startup (Theremi.ai).

My research interests center around Generative AI for AI4Science, with a particular focus on integrating multimodal data (such as knowledge graphs, images, and textual information) into Computer Vision models. Specifically, I work on Diffusion Models and Vision Language Models to advance their application in scientific domains, aiming to build robust, knowledge-guided generative AI architectures.

I'm proud to be part of the [Imageomics Institue](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) funded by NSF and the [Sanghani Center for AI & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/person/mridul-khurana/) at Virginia Tech

Outside academia, I'm passionate about basketball, having played for my undergraduate university's team. I also enjoy hiking and playing drums-always up for a jam session!
