Hi :wave: Welcome to my personal space !

A little about me. I am a Computer Science Master’s student at Virginia Tech and I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Knowledge-guided Machine Learning Lab under the guidance of my advisor Prof. Anuj Karpatne. Previously, I had completed by Bachelor’s from BITS Pilani, India in Computer Science and later worked as a Data scientist at Oracle for a year and a half before finally joining VT.

My primary research interests since undergrad have been in the Machine Learning domain. While I explored multiple diverse areas in ML during my undergrad, at Oracle, my primary area of work was Machine Learning in Financial domain. Presently, my research interests include Knowledge-guided Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and multi-modal learning problems. Moreover, I am also interested in Applied ML research in the domains of climate science and social media analytics.

My current work is in Ecological forecasting using Deep Learning. The focus is on lake water quality modeling using a hybrid of Ecological and Machine Learning models. Primarily, my research involves sequential deep learning models and Time-Series (TS) forecasting, especially knowledge transfer in TS forecasting.

Apart from academia, I love spending time outdoors, especially cycling in the beautiful trails of Blacksburg and going for hikes. Moreover, I am passionate about soccer and table tennis, and recently have started learning the violin too !
